# 💰 EKS Cluster Pricing 💰

Learn about the pricing details of Amazon EKS Cluster and its components.

## 🚨 Step-01: Very Important EKS Pricing Note 🚨

- ⚠️ EKS is not free (Unlike some other AWS Services).
- 💸 In short, there is no free-tier for EKS.

### 🏷️ EKS Cluster Pricing 🏷️

- 💵 We pay $0.10 per hour for each Amazon EKS cluster.
    - **Per Day**: $2.4
    - **For 30 days**: $72

### 🖥️ EKS Worker Nodes Pricing - EC2 🖥️

- 💵 You pay for AWS resources (e.g., EC2 instances or EBS volumes).
- 💡 Example: T3 Medium Server in N.Virginia:
    - **$0.0416 per Hour**
    - **Per Day**: $0.9984 - Approximately $1
    - **Per Month**: $30 for 1 t3.medium server
- 📎 **Reference**: [EC2 On-Demand Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/)
- 📊 In short, if we run 1 EKS Cluster and 1 t3.medium worker node **continuously** for 1 month, our bill is going to be around $102 to $110.
- 🔍 If we take 5 days to complete this course, and if we run 1 EKS Cluster and 2 t3.medium Worker nodes continuously for 5 days, it will cost us approximately around $25.

### 🚀 EKS Fargate Profile 🚀

- 💰 AWS Fargate pricing is calculated based on the **vCPU and memory** resources used from the time you start to download your container image until the EKS Pod terminates.
- 📎 **Reference**: [AWS Fargate Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/pricing/)
- 🌍 Amazon EKS support for AWS Fargate is available in us-east-1, us-east-2, eu-west-1, and ap-northeast-1.

### 📝 Important Notes 📝

- 🚨 **Important Note-1**: If you are using your personal AWS Account, then ensure you delete and recreate the cluster and worker nodes as and when needed.
- 🚨 **Important Note-2**: We can't stop our EC2 Instances which are in the Kubernetes cluster unlike regular EC2 Instances. So, we need to delete the worker nodes (Node Group) if we are not using it during our learning process.
